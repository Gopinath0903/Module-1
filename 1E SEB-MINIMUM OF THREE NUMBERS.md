 Experiment No: 1e â€“ SEB-Minimum of Three Numbers

## AIM  
To write a program to find minimum between three integer numbers using conditional Expression(Ternary)


## ALGORITHM  

1. **Start**
2. **Input** three numbers: `a`, `b`, and `c`
3. **Find** the minimum value among the three and store it in `d`
4. **Display** the result: "The minimum of a, b, c is d"
5. **End**



## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212223070007
# Name-Gopinath G
# Write your code here
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
d=min(a,b,c)
print(f"The minimum of {a}, {b}, {c} is",d)
```
