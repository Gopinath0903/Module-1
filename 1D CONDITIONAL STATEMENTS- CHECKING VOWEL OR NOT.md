## Experiment No: 1d â€“ Conditional Statements-  find the smallest among three Integer  Numbers

## AIM  
To Write a  python program to find the smallest among three Integer  Numbers
## ALGORITHM  


1. **Start**
2. **Input** number `a`
3. **Input** number `b`
4. **Input** number `c`
5. Set `d` to the smallest of `a`, `b`, and `c`
6. **Output** `d` as the smallest number
7. **End**


## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212223070007
# Name-Gopinath G
# Write your code here

a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
d=min(a,b,c)
print("The Smallest  of the three a=",a,"b=",b,"c=",c,"is",d)
